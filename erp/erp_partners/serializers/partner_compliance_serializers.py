File:
    erp_partners/serializers/partner_compliance_serializers.py

Purpose:
    Defines serializers for partner compliance summary.

Architectural Notes:
    - This module manages common Business Partner / Stakeholder master data.
    - Customer, Supplier, Employee, FAR, Finance, and other module-specific profiles
      must be implemented in their respective modules.
    - This module should remain a core shared service with minimum external dependency.
